H2O Wave Framework[1] is a software stack for building beautiful, low-latency, real-time, browser-based applications and dashboards entirely in Python without using HTML, Javascript, or CSS.
It is really easy to use the framework to build web apps, especially for data visualization related tasks.<br>

A couple of months back, I got to know about Wave Framework and I thought of learning it.
As usual, I created a small application, Tic Tac Toe game, using the framework using v0.17.0 SDK.
The game has the ability to play with user and application.
Further application is provided with selecting the game mode; Easy, Medium, and Hard.
In Easy mode, the application will perform a random move while in Medium mode, the application's next move is determined by attempting to block the opponent.
Hard Mode is set up with Minimax algorithm[2].

Try the game by cloning <a href="https://github.com/ShehanIshanka/tic-tac-toe" target="_top">github repo</a>. !!!!!
